# Classical Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of **10 classical Machine Learning projects** built using:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-Learn**

The goal of this repo is to master the **foundations of ML** before moving into Deep Learning and PyTorch.  
Each project includes complete workflows:
- Data loading  
- Cleaning & preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Evaluation  
- Visualizations  

> ⚡ **Note:** This repository will continue to grow.  
> I will keep adding more classical ML projects over time, covering advanced preprocessing, imbalanced learning, pipeline automation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo is part of a **14-day Machine Learning sprint**, focused on:
- Strengthening ML fundamentals  
- Building real, clean, reproducible projects  
- Preparing for Deep Learning with PyTorch  
- Enhancing placement and internship portfolio  

> 🔥 **More classical ML projects** (15+, 20+, etc.) will be added gradually to make this a complete classical ML portfolio for anyone entering machine learning.
